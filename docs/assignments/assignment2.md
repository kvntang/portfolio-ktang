## 3. Feature Brainstorming (15-20 ideas)


**1. My Moods**: different content discovery spaces for one individual user

**2. Sharing Social glimpses**: selectively add friend's or influencer's "moods", also share your own curated/trained algorithm

**3. Browse Jam**: Be lazy but with friend! Scroll the same feed live with friends

**4. Algorithm Mixing**: Mix and mash your feed with your friends

**5. Content Buddy**: Analytics to show who you share similar feeds with

**6. Suggestion Card**: Each card is a different content category

**7. Region Hopping**: Change feed's based on location, see what's trending in different parts of the world

**8. World Average**: See what the average platform user likes

**9. Polar identities/Flip the coin**: different from moods, algorithm creates an opposite feed that contrasts your main feed. Flip! Tunable parameter of how far.

**10. Time-of-day**: customize on a timeline what contents appear on feed depending on the time of day

**11. Shuffle modes**: similar to Spotify's shuffle, create variants of shuffle with different goals. Random, for me, inspire me, challenge me, surprise me.

**12. My Summary**: Summary on content consumption, good for mindfulness. eg. "you just spent 15 minutes on 58 posts"

**12. Staff picks**: Space for community moderators to post

**13. People-inspired feeds**: Instead of using word filters to narrow down your feed, use user profile search. The search bar will average out the people you have selected to give you a feed based on these profiles.

**14. Locally for you**: Personal suggestion notes based on what you like
