# Assignment 6: User Testing & Analysis


## Task List. 
### Sign up
Instruction: Create a new account.
Rationale: This will test the ease of the sign-up process.

### Explore Feed and Comment
Instruction: Scroll through the main feed and comment on posts.
Rationale: This will test the ease of commenting.

### Post
Instruction: Create a new post.
Rationale: This will test the ease of making a post.

### Change Step
Instruction: Change the step to discover more polar content.
Rationale: This will test if the stepping metaphor is intuitive. It will help provide an answer to if having the control to change what suggestion you get would prompt different intentions to actively explore content outside of your comfort zone.

### Interact with Carousel
Instruction: Explore horizontally into each post.
Rationale: This will test the ease of the carousel and how it fits in the feed experience.



## Report 1
During the first study, the participant navigated the sign-up process, explored the feed, and engaged with the “Change Step” and carousel functionalities. The participant successfully created a new account with no hassle but expressed wished for a bigger confirmation or an onboarding process. Moving into the main feed, they scrolled and commented with relative ease, suggesting a smooth integration of this core functionality. However, in the “Change Step” feature, they seemed curious but unsure, experimenting with different step sizes yet unclear about what each change specifically entailed. The participant vocalized that the metaphor of “stepping” was interesting but wanted additional context on its effects on content recommendations. They didn't know that its purpose is to expose new perspectives. The carousel interaction was relatively smooth, with the depth change making it more visually attractive. They noted that adjusting to horizontal scrolling alongside the vertical feed took some time, feeling somewhat disjointed when switching between feed scrolling and carousel navigation.

Key Findings and Insights:
- Posting was intuitive, though character limits could be displayed more prominently to avoid trial and error.
- The “Change Step” function intrigued the participant but lacked immediate feedback on its purpose, creating hesitation.
- Carousel interaction's correlation with step slider was somewhat confusing initially.
