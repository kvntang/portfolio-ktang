# Assignment 3: Convergent Design


## 1.  Pitch. 

<!-- Write a succinct (100 to 300 word) product pitch for your app, that gives it a name, describes its intended audience, the value that it brings, and some of its key functionality. Feel free to build on what you wrote in the previous assignment, and to draw on the insights you gleaned from your interviews and introspection. Describe the functionality in terms of the central concepts. We recommend drafting this pitch and then returning to adjust and revise it after you have completed your conceptual design. -->

## 2. Functional design. 
<!-- Design a collection of concepts that will embody the functionality of your app; you’ll probably want 5-7 concepts for an app that is sufficiently rich to be interesting but not so complex that it can’t be implemented in the time you have (4 weeks). In some cases, a feature will correspond directly to a concept; in others, you may need to coalesce or split features. Concepts should be semantic, serve a distinct purpose, and be mutually independent. Each concept should be described with the standard parts: name, purpose, operational principle, state, and actions. You can write the principle informally, so long as it’s clear which actions are being referred to. The state should be defined using sets and relations. The actions can be written informally, or using the set/relation syntax illustrated in class. Define the app-level actions as synchronizations of concept actions, and instantiate generic concepts with appropriate types. Draw a dependency diagram showing the possible subsets. -->

<!-- Remember that the goal of this personal project is not just to learn the basics of building a full-stack web app but also to practice innovative design. So your design should have some novel elements to it, such as new concepts (which are not familiar from existing apps), new enhancements of existing concepts (adding actions or state that makes the concept more powerful or flexible or perhaps easier to use), new uses of existing concepts, or new synchronizations between existing concepts. -->


## 3. Wireframes. 
<!-- Construct a set of wireframes that shows the user interface elements and their layout, and includes some of the main flows. You can omit error handling and completely standard interactions (such as user registration), but your wireframes should otherwise be enough to cover all your concepts. -->

## 4. Design iteration. 
<!-- As you work on your functional design and wireframes, you should simulate the execution in your mind, considering each step the user might take and how the app would react. You should also have in mind the social/ethical concerns that you considered in the last assignment, and how they might be impacted by the decisions you’re making. As you do this, you will encounter problems that you have to resolve and choices to make. Note down the issues as they arise, and the options you considered; you won’t hand these notes in, but they’ll be useful in the next step. -->

## 5. Design tradeoffs. 
<!-- Using the notes that you took during your design, pick at least 3 design decisions that you made in which you had to choose between multiple options. For each one, provide (a) a pithy title naming the issue; (b) an outline of what the various options were; (c) a rationale for why you chose one option over the others. Try to keep your analysis below 300 words in total (for all the tradeoffs). -->
