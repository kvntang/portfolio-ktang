# Project Phase 1: Impact Case


## Team Contract

The following is a team contract for MIT 6.1040. The following are the terms of the team contract:

Our expected level of achievement is to get the best grade possible and be able to create a feasible app we can possibly even use ourselves. We plan to budget whatever time necessary to be able to sustain this with our teammates and will communicate when certain weeks may be tougher so we can balance work together.

These are the personal goals of each team member:
- Heather: I want to be able to learn better about the coding aspect of creating an app since I felt like I understood the design aspects well
- Shih-Peng: I would like to focus more on the front-end design and be able to write modular code that is easy to modify. Also I would like to learn how to work with my teammates for a full-stack project.
- Kevin: I would like to focus on constructing backend and efficient data storage. Also I would like to get better at frontend styling.
- Brianna: I would like to focus on backend design and learning how to work collaboratively with other team members on a full stack application.

We will plan to meet the same times as regular class section at MIT Campuss, alongside with meetings with TA Dana on Mondays during class time (2:30-3:15PM)
Quality of work will be maintained during check ups at our meeting times, as well as team review meetings via Zoom

Tasks will be assigned at the start of the release of each assignment. If deadlines are missed, we will alert our group members if necessary to have it be done as soon as possible. In regards to tasks, unless a team member is having a rough week:
- The amount of work per team member must be roughly the same over the length of the project; and
- Each team member must participate in all stages and in all activities (eg, interviewing, designing, coding, etc).
- Decisions will be made collectively and through effective communication via Zoom or in-person for severe disagreements



## Impact Case

The problem of maintaining meaningful connections with loved ones is important because many people struggle to find the time or emotional capacity for deep conversations due to physical distance, time constraints, or the emotional strain/turmoil from having such conversations. This can lead to feelings of isolation, reduced emotional support, and weakened bonds, especially when there may not be enough time to connect. 

Our solution to address this problem is an app that creates a low-pressure space for loved ones to connect through guided prompts about personal topics. This allows for meaningful connection without requiring physical proximity or intensive time commitments, as it only requires one message at a time.

We believe this app is a good solution because it provides a structured and flexible way for loved ones to share experiences and learn more about each other without the burden of scheduling long conversations. The prompts reduce the barrier to opening up, making it easier to maintain close connections over time, even with busy or distant loved ones, especially when people do not even know when to start.

We could measure the frequency and depth of shared messages, user engagement with prompts, and self-reported feelings of connection to prove that our app helps people maintain and deepen their relationships, even across distance and busy schedules to prove that our app would be a good solution to developing more meaningful connections between people.



## Identify Interviewees

### Potential Stakeholders
- Young Adults: People who have a busy lifestyle with their work or for other reasons so that they do not have enough time to see them
- Long-Distance Family Members: Family members who wish to stay connected but struggle due to time zones or busy schedules
- Couples in Long-Distance Relationships: Couples who experience the challenges of being intimate due to distance
- Elderly: Elderly individuals who may find technology challenging but want to stay in touch with their family members that are not near

### Potential Experts
- Psychologist: an expert who specializes in emotional connection, long-distance relationships, and the impact of reduced face-to-face communication
- Experts in emotional health and well-being: able to understand the impact of long-distance communication tools and supporting mental health
- Expert in UI/UX design: what certain designs are easier, especially in regard to a target audience that may include the elderly, in terms of easy usage but also aesthetics



## Research on Gaps

The following are some applications that are related to our impact case but do not fully meet the application that we have envisioned..
**SumOne**
An application to promote communication and intimacy between couples. Every day, a prompt/question ranging from light-hearted to profound one is provided for the couple to answer. As the couple participates more, the virtual pet “EggMon” evolves, representing the growth of the relationship. A new feature includes a calendar view to record special events or dates for couples.
**Klokbox**
A digital time capsule where users can add photos, videos, and audio messages to the “story boxes”, which allows users to control who and when sees the content, which enables the elderly to allow their family/descendants to “access one’s memory”.
**StoryWorth**
It is a service that guides people through a storytelling process. The person receives a question via email every day about a meaningful experience or family story. After a year, those stories are bound into a hardcover book.
**Inalife**
It is a legacy platform for families to create and share memories across generations, where photos, videos and stories can be stored. Those memories are only accessible to a selected family circle. Users can also build their family tree in this application and message their family.
**Episode**
It is an interactive storytelling platform for users to write and publish their own interactive stories. This application features a scripting tool to simplify story creation, making it simpler for story-telling beginners.
**Memory Tree**
Tree of Memories is a free app that allows you to plant trees with partners by answering interesting questions and sharing daily diaries.


Hence, the followings are the gap that the current applications do not serve the needs of stakeholders:

**Guided Prompt**
StoryWorth has guided prompts for users; yet, it is less interactive and people who want to view those memories can only access it from the physical book, which does not satisfy the need of diminishing the distance. SumOne provides the same prompt for all users on each day, which does not provide much guidance and is customized and is only limited to relationship-related questions.
**Connection Subjects**
As mentioned, SumOne only allows information exchange for couples. Inalife only allows for family members. In those existing applications, memory storage applications are often limited to intended use such as couples and families, which are less flexible. Klokbox is relatively flexible, but it serves as a time capsule, which is less interactive and less convenient to obtain information promptly. We are looking for a more flexible way to connect memories to people-people connection.
**Engaging Environment to Share**
SumOne passively forces users to answer the questions, or the new question will not update, which might intimate the user if there are some questions that are hard to answer. StoryWorth sends daily email, which is also slightly passive-aggressive to request new stories. Other applications do not give particular motivation for the user to share their stories. Here, we are looking for a prompted-based, feedback system to make sharing more engaging!




## Explore Impacts
**Stakeholders:**
- Non-targeted use: Due to the app being able to support long-distance communication and conversational messages, the app has the potential of unintentionally becoming a regular messaging app where users outside the US communicate in normal conversation with users in the US rather than doing the prompts. This could potentially dilute the purpose of the app, which is to facilitate deep conversations, between loved ones.

- Variation in human ability: Our app heavily relies on sight in order to read the prompts and participate in the online messaging. For users who are sight-impaired, it may be hard for them to use the app and potentially exclude them from using the app.

**Time:**
- Sustained Friendships: Our app may negatively influence how users make and sustain friendships with their loved ones due to its emphasis on consistency. Users may be consistent in engaging in “deep” conversations with their loved ones, but these conversations may turn to be one-sided, obligatory, surface level, etc. if the user is just engaging in the conversations to maintain a streak.

- Choosing not to use: Elderly or non-technologically savvy loved ones may choose not to use the app due to them thinking that they won’t know how to use the technology to communicate with other loved ones, even if they wanted to. These potential users could be excluded from the community formed by our app and wouldn’t be able to enjoy the benefits of using the app to engage in deep conversations with their loved ones consistently.

**Pervasiveness:**
- Crossing National Boundaries: Our app may experience deployment challenges in some countries due to privacy laws and censorship in some countries. Some of the content on the app may be historical content from the lens of individuals (i.e. a older user telling their younger loved one about life in their country), which depending on the content and the information it discloses about people or the country, could be subject to censorship or further processing in order to comply with the country that the app is trying to be deployed to. This interferes with the authenticity of the app’s content and could add complexity on how we think about accommodating users that are using the app in different countries.

**Values:**
- Value Tension: Our app supports the value of facilitating community through guided prompts but also protects the privacy of users since they are sharing personal stories. These two values of facilitating community through online conversations and protecting the privacy of users conflict. This could lead to the unintended consequence of identifying information about users or people involved with the user being revealed through conversations or stories being revealed that were not meant to be revealed.

- User Experience of Values: Even though we as designers believe that our app is facilitating relationships and community among loved ones, users who use the app may feel that it distances them from their loved ones due to the virtual aspect of the conversations. Users may feel that the ability to converse with their loved ones about deep topics online deters users from establishing community and relationship building outside of the app face-to-face with their loved ones.

- Environmental Sustainability: When the app grows in popularity and amasses many users, the amount of data that needs to be stored (i.e. the conversations, user information, etc.) will be stored in data centers. This contributes to negative environmental effects caused by data centers such as water consumption, noise pollution, energy consumption, and more.

### Interview Key takeaways

#### Dani

Dani, a 20-year-old Cuban immigrant, primarily communicates with her family in Cuba and some relatives in the U.S., though her connections vary in frequency and depth. Most of her extended family is in Cuba, where limited resources and sporadic internet access challenge consistent communication. Her main family connection happens through a group chat with her mom’s side, discussing birthdays, family updates, and life situations in Cuba, but she feels distant from her extended family, particularly cousins in Cuba, due to a combination of language barriers, generational gaps, and minimal shared experiences.

Key Takeaways:

Communication Gaps and Generational Differences: Dani’s interactions with family are mostly superficial, with deeper conversations reserved for closer family members in the U.S. This gap is more pronounced with older or younger family members, who either lack the tech skills (like her grandma) or don’t engage frequently (her younger cousins).

Desire for Cultural Connection: Despite the distance, Dani shows interest in learning about her family’s past and culture. She feels a lack of closeness with her family in Cuba but is curious to explore her roots and understand her family's history, particularly through more meaningful conversations.

Technology Challenges: While Dani uses various communication apps (WhatsApp, iMessage, Facebook), her experience varies across platforms. She finds WhatsApp best for international communication but dislikes Facebook due to privacy concerns. Despite her curiosity about new apps for meaningful conversations, she is skeptical about how prompts alone could drive continued engagement without richer, back-and-forth conversations.

Potential Value of a Memory Archive: Dani expressed that a digital archive of conversations, if meaningful, would be beneficial for revisiting family memories and stories. Currently, she values saved pictures from group chats but lacks an emotional connection to conversations that feel superficial.

Implications for Solution Design:

Cultural Prompts: Incorporate culturally meaningful prompts that encourage family members to share stories from the past or their experiences related to heritage. This could foster connection and help users like Dani bridge the cultural gap with family members they may not know well.

Interactive Memory Archive: A feature that allows users to archive and annotate photos, notes, or past conversations could be compelling. The app could facilitate deeper connections by making past interactions accessible and valuable over time.

Incremental Engagement: Ensure the app offers a mix of low-commitment prompts that grow in depth over time, creating a comfortable starting point for hesitant users while supporting the development of deeper connections.

#### Skylar
Background and Family Connections: Skylar is a college student with a background in psychology, currently studying inclusive education. Her family is small and close-knit, primarily consisting of her mother and sister. Most other relatives live in New York and Pennsylvania, and she mostly connects with them through phone calls, though not frequently. Her mother maintains regular contact with Skylar’s grandmother (her “nana”) and aunt, but Skylar herself struggles with consistent communication due to busy schedules on both sides.

Communication Habits and Preferences: Skylar primarily connects with her family via phone calls, preferring the real-time and vocal aspects of calls over texting, which she finds lacks tone and emotional nuance. While FaceTime is an option, she doesn't see it as necessary for every conversation. When she does connect, conversations tend to be long (30-90 minutes) and start with small updates, often evolving into discussions about family dynamics.

Challenges in Maintaining Connections:

Busy Schedules: Skylar’s family members often have conflicting schedules, making it hard to coordinate calls, especially with extended family.
Feeling Hesitant to Reach Out: Skylar’s grandmother, for example, is reluctant to initiate contact if she perceives Skylar as busy, which limits spontaneous interactions.
Infrequent Interaction: Skylar would like to connect more often but struggles with finding a balance that fits into her academic and personal responsibilities.
Desire for Deeper Connections: Skylar expresses an interest in understanding her family history, particularly through stories and old photos that capture family traditions and individual experiences. Additionally, she wishes for a way to explore deeper topics, such as family trauma, which she finds insightful from a psychological perspective but sensitive to discuss directly. Regular, meaningful conversations would also help her feel more connected to her relatives' personal lives and interests.

Attitudes Towards Digital Tools and Solutions:

Preference for Phone Calls: Skylar values real-time voice conversations and doesn’t often use texting, as she feels it lacks depth.
Past Experience with Guided Prompts: She has used the "36 Questions that Lead to Love," a set of questions for connecting with someone, and appreciates its structured approach, which builds trust and vulnerability gradually.
App Usability and Design: Skylar values intuitive interfaces, such as widgets and notifications, that make apps feel accessible. However, she’s cautious about trying new apps and needs to see value in them before committing time.
Interest in Family History and Memories:

Skylar’s family has a physical archive (photo boxes at her grandmother’s) but rarely revisits it. She prefers tangible memories over digital, feeling that in-person interactions have a stronger emotional impact.
While she’s not particularly drawn to keeping a digital archive, she acknowledges the benefit of revisiting past conversations to maintain the accuracy of memories and reinforce meaningful connections.
Key Takeaways:

Desire for Structured, Meaningful Conversations: Skylar appreciates guided prompts that encourage vulnerability and build trust in a structured way. This could be particularly valuable in discussing deeper topics like family history or trauma.

Value of Real-Time, Voice-Based Communication: Skylar prefers phone calls for their immediacy and emotional depth, making voice messages or real-time calls a more effective way for her to stay connected than texting or social media.

Challenges with Frequency and Accessibility: While Skylar would like to connect more frequently, coordinating schedules and managing other responsibilities make this difficult. A solution that facilitates shorter, frequent interactions could help her maintain regular contact without needing to plan around everyone’s availability.

Interest in Learning Family and Cultural History: Skylar is interested in family traditions and generational experiences that contribute to her understanding of family culture. Tools that enable family members to share stories, memories, or meaningful artifacts (e.g., photos with explanations) would be engaging for her.

Sensitive Approach to Difficult Topics: Skylar wishes to explore family trauma and its generational impact, which requires careful handling due to its sensitivity. Prompts or guided discussions should balance accessibility with an understanding of emotional depth and comfort levels.

Preference for a Tangible Connection: Skylar feels more connected to physical memories than digital ones, so incorporating tangible elements (like printable photo memories) could enhance the experience.

Implications for the Proposed Solution:

Guided Prompts with Gradual Vulnerability: Incorporate prompts that start with light, familiar topics and gradually explore deeper areas like family history or emotional insights. This structured approach could make it easier for Skylar and her family to discuss sensitive or overlooked subjects comfortably.

Voice and Real-Time Interaction Features: Given her preference for voice over text, the app could include options for voice notes, real-time calls, or short video messages to preserve vocal tone and enhance the personal feel of each interaction.

Design for Accessibility and Ease of Use: Widgets and reminders could make the app easier to incorporate into Skylar’s routine, while intuitive, straightforward design would support her preference for apps that feel valuable and accessible without much effort.

Support for Family Archives with Annotations: While she’s less inclined toward digital archiving, Skylar might appreciate an archive that allows for photo annotations or audio descriptions. This would provide a way to share and interpret family history collaboratively, adding a personal layer to the visual memories.

Encouragement for Short, Regular Interactions: Instead of long, infrequent conversations, the app could facilitate shorter, meaningful interactions that require minimal planning. This would allow Skylar to connect with family more consistently within the constraints of her schedule.


#### Kevin's Grandpa
Primary Communication Platform: Kevin’s Grandpa, at 85 years old, primarily uses WeChat, particularly appreciating the app for its ease of use and occasional cooking content. He dislikes apps that require installations or disrupt his preferred setup, preferring a simple, controlled digital environment.

Minimal Contact and Purpose-Driven Communication: His interactions with family are rare, and he perceives little incentive to actively participate in family group chats due to the absence of urgent topics or specific goals. Conversations without a clear purpose or objective feel unnecessary to him. He values communication that has a defined goal or functional purpose, rather than casual or routine check-ins.

Social Engagement Preferences: Kevin’s Grandpa has a low desire for frequent social interaction, both digitally and in person. Organizing social events feels exhausting due to the associated responsibilities of cooking, cleaning, and preparation. He believes that older adults generally do not socialize frequently and feels that maintaining minimal social engagement aligns with his needs. While he acknowledges that Western culture may be more inclusive of seniors in family activities, he doesn’t personally feel a strong need for regular inclusion or social gatherings.

Grandchildren’s Photos and Physical Keepsakes: He appreciates receiving photos of his grandchildren every 1-2 months, preferring these infrequent updates as they maintain novelty and allow him to notice growth and change. He prints these photos to add to an album, valuing the tangible collection that marks his grandchildren’s development. Occasionally, he annotates these photos to offer guidance or express concerns, feeling that this allows him to stay connected and exercise a sense of care or influence in their lives.

Reserved Approach to Sharing and Recording: Kevin’s Grandpa limits video and audio calls primarily to interactions with his great-grandchildren. He keeps his personal hobbies, like calligraphy, private, assuming others aren’t interested in them and feeling no need to record or share these activities.

Key Takeaways:

Preference for Purposeful, Infrequent Communication: Communication should have a clear goal or purpose. He’s unlikely to initiate or sustain casual conversation but engages meaningfully when there’s a reason to reach out.

Low Engagement Needs: Frequent social interaction is not a priority. His engagement style aligns more with selective, quality interactions rather than routine updates or group chats.

Appreciation for Physical Keepsakes: Kevin’s Grandpa values printed photos and tangible mementos, which provide him with a lasting, physical reminder of family connections. He enjoys observing gradual changes in his grandchildren over time and values these infrequent updates.

Interest in Offering Guidance: His annotations on family photos show he values providing advice or expressing gentle concerns, particularly about family members’ well-being.

Reserved Social Engagement: Given his perception of social interaction as tiring, tools aiming to engage him should respect his preference for minimal involvement. He may prefer options that don’t require active participation or frequent check-ins but still allow him to feel connected.

Implications for a Family Connection Solution:

Purposeful Prompts and Notifications: An app designed for users like Kevin’s Grandpa could prioritize prompts that offer specific reasons for communication, such as family updates or milestone notifications, to engage him without feeling burdensome.

Support for Tangible Memories: Integrating a feature for printable photo collections or offering a way to annotate photos for family members could align well with his preferences, allowing him to stay engaged in a meaningful yet minimal way.

Low-Maintenance Interaction Options: Tools that facilitate occasional, purposeful connections, like monthly updates or milestone reminders, would align better with his preference for infrequent but meaningful engagement.

Privacy-Respecting Features: Given his inclination toward privacy, any solution should respect personal boundaries, allowing him to engage without feeling obligated to share details about his private life or hobbies.

Minimal Notifications and Simple Design: Since Kevin’s Grandpa prefers a controlled digital environment, an interface that minimizes notifications and disruptions would help him feel comfortable using it.

#### Wan-Ching
Background and Family Connections: Wan-Ching is a 45-year-old housewife living in Taiwan with her husband and child. She lives close to her parents, whom she visits almost daily. While her relationship with family is close, she prefers a passive role in communication, rarely reaching out proactively and preferring minimal engagement in deeper discussions.

Communication Habits and Preferences: Wan-Ching’s communication style is practical and purposeful:

Frequent In-Person Visits: She values in-person interactions with her immediate family, especially her parents, whom she visits regularly.
Passive Social Media Use: When family members are far away, she occasionally checks social media profiles to stay updated but doesn’t actively reach out.
Limited, Purposeful Conversations: With those she’s close to, she can enjoy lengthy conversations on varied topics. Otherwise, she prefers shorter exchanges or updates.
Challenges in Maintaining Connections:

Avoidance of Proactive Outreach: Wan-Ching rarely initiates contact, particularly with people who don’t use social media. This passive approach means she often misses updates from those not actively posting online.
“Boomer Graphics” as Indicators of Presence: Although she initially disliked these stereotypical “boomer graphics,” she now sees them as comforting reminders of a person’s well-being.
Preference for Low-Commitment Interaction: She describes herself as a “lurker” who prefers watching others chat rather than engaging herself. She appreciates feeling present without the pressure of active participation.
Emotional Connection: Wan-Ching is comfortable discussing practical updates but avoids personal or emotional topics, a tendency shaped by traditional Chinese cultural values. She is introverted and dislikes sharing personal issues, even with close family members.

Attitudes Towards Digital Tools and Solutions:

Limited Interest in Sharing Through Digital Tools: While she enjoys seeing updates, Wan-Ching values privacy and finds it difficult to share personal thoughts or emotions.
Openness to New Apps: She is comfortable exploring new software and tools as long as they offer an improvement over current options. She prefers apps with clean, single-page interfaces that allow easy access to desired information.
Interest in Guided Prompts with Conditions: Wan-Ching likes the idea of conversation prompts to inspire new topics, provided she has the choice to engage in these topics as desired.
Interest in Family Memories and Archives: Wan-Ching appreciates memories but prefers to revisit them passively. She occasionally stumbles upon old photos or videos on her phone, which she finds delightful, especially for family moments from years ago. She likes Facebook’s “memory” feature, which shows past interactions on significant dates. Her most cherished memories are from family gatherings during holidays, which allow for in-person bonding.

Key Takeaways:

Preference for Low-Pressure Communication: Wan-Ching enjoys maintaining a passive presence in family connections, engaging on her own terms without feeling pressured to respond immediately or share personal matters.

Value in Passive Social Media Use: She appreciates using social media to observe updates rather than initiate contact, allowing her to stay informed without needing active engagement.

Fondness for Occasional, Meaningful Reminders: She finds value in low-commitment interactions, such as “boomer graphics,” as gentle reminders of someone’s presence.

Interest in Revisiting Shared Memories: Wan-Ching likes looking back at memories, especially if these capture nostalgic or funny family moments. Facebook’s memory feature appeals to her, as it’s unobtrusive but still meaningful.

Openness to New Digital Solutions with Personal Control: She would consider an app that allows for conversation prompts, provided she has control over her level of engagement and privacy.

Preference for Physical Interactions for Meaningful Moments: In-person gatherings, especially during holidays, are her most valued way to connect, as these allow emotions and warmth to be expressed naturally.

Implications for a Family Connection Solution:

Low-Commitment Notification and Passive Updates: The app could provide subtle notifications of family members’ milestones or updates, allowing her to stay informed without needing active engagement.

Option for Memory Prompts and Archives: She may enjoy a feature that occasionally brings up past family memories, similar to Facebook’s “memory” function, so she can reflect on shared moments without constant interaction.

Guided Prompts with Engagement Control: Introducing optional conversation prompts that respect her preference for non-personal topics could help her feel engaged without the pressure to share personal details. Allowing her to choose prompts could make her feel more comfortable participating.

Physical Keepsakes or Tangible Interaction Options: Since Wan-Ching values physical mementos, offering printable photo or memory options could enhance her connection with these memories, aligning with her appreciation for in-person interactions and tangible reminders.



## Revised Impact Case

The problem of maintaining meaningful, generational family connections is important because within the framework of the ecological theory, our family microsystem—parents, grandparents, siblings—play an important role in shaping our culture, values, and personal identity. However, physical distance, busy schedules, and sometimes emotional sensitivities when trying to start conversations make it difficult to engage in these conversations, resulting in lost memories and missed opportunities for connection.

Our solution to address this problem is an app that creates a shared memory space for family members to contribute to over time. It provides both personalized and structured prompts to guide insightful conversations, with additional “deeper” questions as conversations and greater memories are shared, which allow family members to annotate and share photos, and lets users gradually discover stories from their relatives, creating a sense of connection even across distance. The app’s low-commitment prompts encourage quick yet consistent use, while shared “memory threads” enable multi-user contributions to a single memory.

We believe this is a good solution because it combines casual, low-pressure prompts that can align with people’s busy schedules with intentional archiving, allowing family members to share stories and insights at their own pace. By progressively deepening prompts and having the inclusion of AI support when creating follow-up questions for initial personalized pr5ompts, the app can guide family members into meaningful discussions. Features like skippable and personalized prompts, archiving/unarchiving past prompts to be able to go back and forth from past memories, annotations for photos to be able to explain photos better, and an easy-to-view archive differs from other apps in that the content can be memory specific for each prompt and allows flexibility in its prompts compared to other “memory-sharing” apps.

We could measure engagement rates (which includes both frequency of using the app and prompt completion), the diversity of contributions within shared “memories” of a variety of users of different groups (age, occupation, nationality), and user-reported feelings of how connected or close they now feel to their relative to prove that our app effectively deepens family connections and helps users uncover past history and information about their family members that contribute to a stronger sense of their own identity and values.
